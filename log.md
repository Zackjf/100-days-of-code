# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2018
The Project for the next week is to set up a simple MongoDB/Express/Node/Pug App with a focus on learning the database, route with Express, and learn Pug from start to finish. I'll use a simple bootstrap template to get started and make it sexy.

Specs: 

Use Yarn and NPM for package management of bootstrap and more 
Use Express-Generator 
Set up Routes for different pages 
Translate certain words based on parameters - ex. Ni Hao or Hello
Contact Form should send Name, Email, and Phone Number to a MongoDB Database 
Node should send an email to the email provided
Project should be fully deployed on either Digital Ocean or AWS
I should learn how to set up a code linter.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
